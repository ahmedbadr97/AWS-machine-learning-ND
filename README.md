# AWS-machine-learning-ND
- this is a summary from AWS machine learning Nano degree provided by udacity
- AWS Machine Learning Engineer (MLE) Nanodegree program is to equip software developers 
data scientists with the data science and machine learning skills required to build and deploy machine
learning models in production using Amazon SageMaker. This program will focus on the latest best practices
and capabilities that are enabled by Amazon SageMaker, including new model design/deployment features
and case studies in which they can be applied to.

- the Nano degree Consits of 4 courses with 4 projects and CAPSTONE PROJECT: Inventory Monitoring at Distribution Centers

[Course 1: Introduction to Machine Learning](/intorduction to machine learning)
-  start learning what machine learning is by being introduced to the high level concepts
through AWS SageMaker. Youâ€™ll begin by using SageMaker Studio to perform exploratory data analysis.
Know how and when to apply the basic concepts of machine learning to real world scenarios. Create
machine learning workflows, starting with data cleaning and feature engineering, to evaluation and
hyperparameter tuning. Finally,  build new ML workflows with highly sophisticated models such as
XGBoost and AutoGluon.
- Course Project : Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon
  - apply the knowledge and methods in the Introduction to Machine Learning course to compete in a Kaggle competition. Using the AutoGluon framework train a baseline model, then improve their model through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning. Finally, submit  optimized model for a public Kaggle rank and write a report  to showcase the work done.
